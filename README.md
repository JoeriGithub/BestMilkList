# BestMilkList
A collection of the best presets on Project M music visualizer.

When I use [Project M](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) when listening to music some of the low effort presets really started bothering me.
So Im making an list with only my favorite high quality presets for anyone to use.

In your Project M files, replace the presets file with this file and you should be all set. (note: on steam you can find your local files like this: 
click on the cogwheel on the right of the game page in your library -> properties... -> local files -> browse...)


Full credit goes to the creators of the presets and the contributors of https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm
